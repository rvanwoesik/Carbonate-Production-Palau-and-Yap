This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water
habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific
Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the
value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether
that value varied across habitats.
